// 4-directional BFS from `start`, counting cells reachable without crossing `occupied` or the
// grid edge — the "how much room is left to survive in" heuristic snakeAi.ts scores each candidate
// turn by. Index-walked queue (not Array#shift, which is O(n) per call and would make this
// O(cells²)) since this runs fresh for every candidate direction, every tick.
//
// `maxCount` stops the fill early once the queue reaches that many cells, bounding worst-case
// cost at O(maxCount) regardless of grid size — see CPU_FLOOD_FILL_CAP's own comment for why an
// exact count past that point is never actually needed. Defaults to unbounded for direct/test use.
// `portals` defaults to empty so every existing call site/test (predating portals) stays byte-
// identical — a neighbor landing on a portal cell is redirected to its paired exit before the
// visited/bounds/occupied checks run, the same "let + reassign before any check" shape tickGame's
// own movement resolution uses, so a portal reads to this search as a normal 1-step edge to
// wherever it actually leads, not a boundary (see gameEngine.ts's tickGame for why treating it as
// blocked instead would misjudge reachable space near one). `tunnelCellSet`/`tunnelOccupied` both
// default to empty for the same byte-identical-by-default reason — a tunnel-member cell's blocked
// check routes through `tunnelOccupied` instead of `occupied`, exactly mirroring tickGame's own
// `isBlocked` — otherwise this would see every tunnel cell as unconditionally empty regardless of
// what's actually sitting there underground, the CPU blind spot the mechanic's own params exist to
// close (see cpuAi.ts's callers). `wrapEdges` defaults to false so every existing call site/test
// (predating wrap) stays byte-identical — when true, a neighbor that steps off the grid re-enters
// from the opposite edge (see grid.ts's wrapCell) instead of being treated as a boundary, mirroring
// gameEngine.ts's own tickGame. Applied before the portal check, same order tickGame uses, though
// it's moot in practice: a portal is never placed on an edge cell (see arenas.ts), so a raw
// off-grid `next` can never also be a portal entrance.
//
// Ported verbatim from LightCycles' floodFill.ts — confirmed 100% generic (no LightCycles-specific
// logic), with only the import paths adapted to this project's grid.ts/types. Snake's own AI
// (snakeAi.ts) has no portals/tunnels/wrap-awareness of its own yet and simply never passes those
// params, relying on their defaults — kept here rather than stripped so this stays a byte-identical
// port that can absorb a future LightCycles fix with a straight diff.

// Same 4-directional BFS shape as countReachableCells above, but stops early and returns the
// step-distance to the first cell in `targets` it reaches, or null if none is reachable within
// `maxCount` — used by snakeAi.ts to bias food-seeking without a second, differently-shaped search.
// `portals` follows the identical redirect-before-checks shape countReachableCells above uses;
// `tunnelCellSet`/`tunnelOccupied` follow its identical isBlocked-routing shape, and `wrapEdges`
// follows its identical wrap-before-portal-check shape too.

// Ported verbatim from LightCycles' floodFill.ts — see countReachableCells' own comment above for
// why the portal/tunnel/wrap params are kept even though Snake's own AI never passes them yet.
