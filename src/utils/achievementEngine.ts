// the catalog and getProfileStatsView are module-level constants here, so pre-binding them keeps
// call sites reading as `evaluateUnlockedIds(stats)`/`evaluateUnlockedIdsForProfile(profileStats)`
// rather than threading them through by hand. Same three export names this file has always had, so
// no other call site needs to change its import.
