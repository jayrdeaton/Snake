// The gate mechanism itself (does markReady/useReady/pendingGates behave correctly) is tested in
// @rific/splash-gate's own package, nothing to re-prove here. What's worth guarding in THIS repo
// is that this file declares the exact set of gates the app's real async dependencies need: if a
// future screen (see Theme.tsx) picks up a new one without adding it here, or a name gets dropped
// by accident, the whole point of naming every condition explicitly is defeated silently.
